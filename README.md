# Advanced Methods in Computational Economics

This is an mini-course on "Advanced Methods in Computational
Economics" to solve and estimate dynamic, held from 14.11.2022 - 21.11.2022 at [CREST](https://crest.science/)/[ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/en).


## Purpose of the lectures

* This course is intended to confront M.sc. and Ph.D. students in economics, finance, and related fields with recent tools developed in applied mathematics, machine learning, computational science, and the computational economics literature to solve and estimate (dynamic stochastic) economic models.

* The lectures will be centered around sparse grids, adaptive sparse grids, high-dimensional model representation, two types of machine learning methods (Gaussian Processes and Deep Neural Networks), and will be showcased
in the context of application in macroeconomics, finance, and climate-change economics.

* The lectures will be interactive, in a workshop-like style, that is, a mix of theory and actively playing with code examples (delivered in Python and deployed on a cloud computing infrastructure).


## Detailed list of topics of the mini-course

There will be three lectures (3x45 min per lecture) that will cover the following topics:

**Lecture** | **Date** | **Time** | **Main Topics**
-----------|-----|------|------
[# 1](lectures/lecture_1)| 14.11.2022 | 13:00 - 16:00 | [Sparse Grids, Adaptive Sparse Grids](https://github.com/SparseGridsForDynamicEcon/SparseGrids_in_econ_handbook), and [High-dimensional Model Representation](https://github.com/SparseGridsForDynamicEcon/HDMR).
[# 2](lectures/lecture_2) | 17.11.2022 | 13:00 - 16:00 | Deep Neural Networks, [Deep Equilibrium Nets](https://github.com/sischei/DeepEquilibriumNets), and Deep Surrogates/[Deep Structural Estimation](https://github.com/DeepSurrogate/OptionPricing).
[# 3](lectures/lecture_3)| 21.11.2022 | 13:00 - 16:00 | Gaussian Process Regression and Bayesian Active Learning


## Prerequisites

* Basic econometrics
* Basic programming in Python (see [this link](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html) for a thorough Introduction)
* Basic calculus and probability
* [Mathematics for Machine learning](https://mml-book.github.io/) provides a good overview of skills participants are required to be fluent in.


## Evaluation

Participants who take the course for credits are expected to propose a small
project where they apply some of the methods learned to an application (e.g.,
apply deep learning to a data set, solve a dynamic model, etc.). The deliverable
that will be graded is a short write-up (4-6 pages maximum), the data set (if
any), and the code on which the presented results in the report were based. The
participants will have four weeks time after the course is finished to complete
the task.
